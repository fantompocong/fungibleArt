# fungibleArt (fART)

A possibly scarce tokenized art.
fART is a free mint project, but donations are possible through this function:

`collectFART() external payable {...}`

fungibleArt is deployed on [Fantom Opera Network](https://fantom.foundation/).
Initial liquidity on [SpookySwap](https://spooky.fi/#/add/FTM/0x0378da868aD8BC4E1A4DbE3138B158eF5d980C1a) = 1 fART / 1 FTM

Anyone can mint fART for free (excluding FTM as gas):
1. Go to this [contract](https://ftmscan.com/address/0x0378da868ad8bc4e1a4dbe3138b158ef5d980c1a#code).
2. Connect your wallet, using a burner wallet is advised.
3. Go to function `2. collectFART`, fill some amount of FTM if you want to donate, but if you donâ€™t then simply fill with 0.
4. Click Write then confirm the transaction on your Metamask wallet.
